Not all of the datasets in the repository were used in our final visualisations, but were used for exploratory analysis to aid our findings.

The .ipynb file was created in collaboration with my teammates over the week of the hackathon. Not all code is my own, as this was a group project, each person's code was merged into one notebook file. As a result, some code may seem disjointed. All names and student IDs have been removed for anonymity.
