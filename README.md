# GEOG5303M-Creative-Coding-Hackathons
This repository contains five data science hackathons completed during my Masters studies, developed collaboratively in teams and with an industry partner. Each project addressed real-world urban issues using spatial data science, statistical modelling, and creative coding techniques. 

## Hackathon Projects

### 1: Assessing Greenspace in Leeds - with Healthy and Sustainable Data Service (HASP)
This hackathon involved analysing public green space accessbility in Leeds using 15-minute walking and cycling zones. Using OS Greenspace data and Output Area Classification, we assessed spatial inequality in greenspace across different population groups. We identified areas that are underserved by green space and proposed a strategy to enhance community engagement, biodiversity, and smaller scale interventions like pocket parks to increase access

### 2: Heat Resilience Index for Property Evaluation - with Martello
This project involved our group building a heat resilience index for residential properties in Leeds using Energy Performance Certificate data. A weighted matrix was developed based on property characteristics such as insulation, glazing, building type, and construction date to assess heat stress vulnerability. Python was used to clean very large 'messy' datasets to process the data and generate scores. An improvement index and score was also created to highlight potential retrofit opportunities.

### 3. Healthy High Streets in Bradford - with Healthy Urban Places and Born in Bradford
Investigated the health of high streets in Bradford, using DBSCAN clustering to define high street boundaries. We analysed how different socio-demographic groups accessed amenities. Using CDRC Points of Interest data, Halal food restaurants, census data, and transport infrastructure, we evaluated inclusivity, affordability and other factors that make a high street 'healthy'. Specific high streets were analysed through the lens of youth, elderly, religious and low-income communities.

### 4. Identifying Opportunities for River Re-Meandering - with Mott MacDonald
Explored opportunities for river re-meandering along the East West Rail corridor in England. This project involved identifying suitable watercourses that could be remeandered based on proximity to infrastructure, land cover, agriculture grade and flood risk zones. Using GIS methods, we applied multi-criteria filtering to exclude unsuitable segments and score remaining options for rewilding. The analysis highlighted how nature-based solutions can support things like flood resilience and biodiversity.

### 5. Assessing Bathing Water Quality Visualisation Tool - with the Environmental Agency
This hackathon required us to create a dashboard to help partners easily evaluate water quality classifications and bacteria levels based on certain factors. We cleaned and preprocessed the data given to us by the Environmental Agency, exploring relationships using Spearman's correlations, wind rose plots, and regression models between factors such as wind direction, UV exposure, tidal movement, and seabird presence.
