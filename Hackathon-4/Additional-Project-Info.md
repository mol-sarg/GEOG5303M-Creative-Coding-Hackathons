Not all clipped datasets are available due to them being created by another team member and most are too large for GitHub. As a result of this being done by another group member, the code for clipping is not included. They included roads, railways, protected areas, flood risk areas, contrours, agriculture class all clipped to the East West Rail counties, including Cambridgeshire, Bedford, and Oxfordshire.
